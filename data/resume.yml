        __Web App__

        The user interface for the event creation process was delivered with consistency across each screen. Buttons, text and forms are uniform and compatible cross browser.

        __Themes__

        Users are able to select various themes for their event websites. The themes varied by simple, styled, clean and minimal. Compatible cross browser and was loosely integrated with the platform to assure extensibility in future use cases.
