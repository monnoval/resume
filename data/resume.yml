    shortdesc: Front-end Web Developer always, Back-end Dev sometimes
    desc: |
      __Front-End__ is overwhelming, I swam in the vast realm of tomato sauce poured in a maintainable spaghetti code just to do a tiny push of a pixel.

      __Back-end developers__ loves designers who code. Being in the front-end pool crosses my boundaries of user interface design and development.

      __My bonus points:__

      - Blurred the lines between front-end and back-end development
      - Not afraid of cross browser nuances
      - Ensures maintainable and modular code
      - Loves the command line
      - Huge fan of using version control such as Mercurial and Git
      - Able to collaborate with other engineers, designers and product managers
      - Experience with awesome web technologies, SASS, HAML, Middleman, SingularityGS
