      <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Front-End is overwhelming, I swam in the vast realm of tomato sauce poured in a maintainable spaghetti code just to do a tiny push of a pixel.

      <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left"></i> Back-end developers loves designers who code. Being in the front-end pool crosses my boundaries of user interface design and development.
